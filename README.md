# Setup
Follow the link in binance_keys.py to set up your personal Telegram bot, and get your id token so you can send Telegram messages via your bot to yourself.

# How it works
Every minute (could be faster if you would like) the Binance exchange is checked, if the total amount of symbols listed on their exchange has changed compared to last time a message is send. This message contains the new symbols that got listed on the spot exchange.
